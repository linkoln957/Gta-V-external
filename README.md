Create a **hitsounds** folder inside the **base** Fortnite directory.
Place as many **.wav** sound files as you want inside of it. Load the cheat and they will be under the hitsounds combobox.

Profiles are stored inside the **base** Fortnite directory under a folder named **profiles**.

You can share profiles with friends by navigating to the configuration tab inside the cheat and selecting **Export**. This will copy all profile data to the clipboard which you can then paste to a friend.

To import a profile, just copy all of the profile data and press **Import**. Make sure to save your profile by entering a name and pressing **Save**.
